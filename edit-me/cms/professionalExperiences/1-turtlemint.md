At Turtlemint, I worked with various teams developing client-facing UI / UX for the company's Life / Term / Health Insurance, Device Protection, Mutual Funds and Digital Gold businesses.

As part of the Insurance teams, I worked on adding critical features and change requests to the existing AngularJS 1 application as well as redesigning several user flows to improve UX.

With the Device Protection and Digital Gold teams, I leveraged the capabilities of the company's shared services and UI library to enable distribution of new financial products using the existing distribution channels while meeting very tight deadlines. Tech stack: React, Redux, TypeScript, Jest, Storybook, ANT Design Library

With the Mutual Funds team, I worked on integrating an acquired IP distribution platform for Mutual Fund products into the company's ecosystem. This was a massive undertaking with aggressive timelines. We developed critical new features and user flows while also rewriting many parts of the application entirely due to incompatibility with the ecosystem.

I was also part of the Quality Improvement and Tooling initiatives in the organisation and actively contributed to the Design System and Template projects.
