At Barclays I was one of three UI / UX engineers responsible for building the new authentication and authorisation system "Identity Provider(IDP) 2.0" and Identity Verifier (IDV) 2.0" for the company's internal, vendor-facing and client-facing systems.

My work involved driving my peers and reportees towards end-to-end resolution of all issues and change requests, all geared towards an agressive deadline for enabling CBCCs (Co Branded Credit Cards) with some of the world's largest retailers across the US, Canada and parts of South America.
